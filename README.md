No frills, open source 40% ortholinear keyboard PCB

## Specs

- No backlight, no underglow
- No fancy ESD protection
- No fancy reset circuit
- USB Mini because literally no frills
- STM32F072CBT6

## Requirements

- KiCad 5.0.1
- Default KiCad Schematic Library
- ai03's Switch Footprint Library (included as submodule)

## Notes

1. To be used as a reference for STM32F072CBT6 only
